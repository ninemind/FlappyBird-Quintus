A FlappyBird remake using the Quintus HTML5 gaming engine.  Play it [here](http://ninemind.github.io/FlappyBird-HTML5). It's very small so zoom in (Ctrl +) in your browser to play it larger.  It also will look blurry in Chrome (except on OSX) since the browser does not yet support "nearest-neighbor"  rendering. Load it up in FireFox to keep the quality high when zooming.

**_If there's someone that can help me with getting this game to scale properly on Android devices with CocoonJS it would be much appreciated._**

Notice
======
The visual assets for this game have been extracted from the original game and modified by me for performance.  There is no intention to steal Dong Nguyen's (the original creators) work. This was only an experiment to get myself and others familiarized with the Quintus HTML5 gaming engine.
